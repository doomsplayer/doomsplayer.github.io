  Data scientists often need to get data from different websites (e.g. Yelp, Twitter, Spotify) via their Web APIs. 
  In this talk, we will present DataPrep.connector, a unified API wrapper in Python. It enables data scientists
  to get data from different websites using the same programming interface, 
  significantly simplifying web data collection. This talk will be of interest to all data scientists."
